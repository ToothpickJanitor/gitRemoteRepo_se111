            <b>André DeGrange </b><i>August 15, 2021</i>
            <p><em>A Clockwork Orange</em> is one of my favorite films for many reasons. Firstly I love how Stanley Kubrick shows the audience acts of 'ultraviolence' as they are and does not try to make the audience feel emotions through anything besides the physical acts themselves. This creates a film that is an enjoyable watch because it never has one thing in mind and relies on the audience to think of what is happening. I love how shocking this movie is as no matter who you are you cannot sit down watch this movie and not get some sort of real reaction from it whether it be disgust or awe. I love this movie because of how beautifully constructed almost every scene is and how every corner takes part in the story.</p>
            <p>My favorite part of the film is certainly the music however as it is incredibly futuristic as in the movie's setting and also plain like clockwork. The soundtrack is by Wendy Carlos who was born as Walter Carlos in 1939, she was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and attended Brown University. She rose to prominence with her album <em>Switched-On-Bach</em> which won three grammy awards in 1969 which was a collection so Johann Sebastian Bach played entirely on a Moog synthesizer which catapulted the instrument's popularity as she was an early expirementer of it. I recently was able to attend a zoom call with her because one of my friends is studying composition at a school in Colorado and it was really cool to hear her thoughts on the soundtrack for both this and The Shining as well as her first hand experience with transgender issues in the 1970's. The vocoder in particular is now an incredibly popular effect in modern music where one's voice is sampled and is given a 'robotic' characteristic which can largely attribute its' popularity to this soundtrack here.</p>
